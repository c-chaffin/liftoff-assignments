For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For our project we will be teaming up with the company Startland. We will be building a student portal where students can log on and complete modules, which will include YouTube videos and text provided by Startland. Students will be able to upload their assignments after completing each module. Student uploads will be videos or text. Students will be able to view other students work and comment on it in a forum-type system. There will be a landing page for students after log in that will contain links to the modules that are available as well as announcements concerning the course.

The admin log in will be able to post announcements to the Student landing page. Admins will be able to assign modules to student accounts. They will also be able to grade assignments that have been submitted by students. Finally, admins will be able to upload content for new modules.
### Features
-Authentication system with accounts for students and admins.
-Announcement page for admins to provide updates on the class.
-Forum for students to comment on each others work.
-Tracking system to track student progress.
-Upload system so students can upload completed assignments.
### Technologies
We will be using the MEAN stack. MySQL, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js)
### What I'll Have to Learn
We will need to become more familiar with our entire stack. Some things we have identified as potential problems are authentication with MEAN stack, YouTube embedding/API, creating a forum type system for discussion amongst students (Blackboard type), creating 2 types of accounts with different permissions, upload system for students to turn in assignments.
